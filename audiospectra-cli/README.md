## Audio Spectrum Visualization is a Python project that visualizes real-time audio input as a spectrum using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). It provides an interactive and dynamic interface for users to start the visualization and exit the program.

### Notable point : From v4.0, I have implemented a whole new code using PyQt5, which you will find evident here in the new main default code - [&#39;main.py&#39;](../Audio_SpectraCLI/main.py) and the [&#39;test.py&#39;](../tests/test.py) case supporting that.

### The [&#39;main-old.py&#39;](../Audio_SpectraCLI/main-old.py), which is the code for the main file for v3.2, and the [&#39;test-old.py&#39;](../tests/test-old.py) case supporting that, is DEPRECATED.

## Current Features (with respect to 4.1.0)

- Real-time visualization of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) spectrum of audio input.
- **Live in-editor visualization**: the extension spawns a headless Python
  process and streams the spectrum into a real VS Code webview panel (see
  "Using the Commands" below) - not just a code-snippet inserter.
- Support for adjusting parameters such as duration, sampling rate, and block size.
- Seamless integration with SoundDevice for audio input capture.
- Customizable Frequency Range: Allow users to specify the frequency range to display in the spectrum.
- Color Customization: Provide options for users to customize the colors used in the spectrum visualization.
- Added PyQt5 modules and a Gaussian filter that enables user input for Duration (in seconds), Sampling Rate (in Hz), Block Size, and also smoothens the output.
- Might need to keep in mind that the Gaussian filter is too strong and it won't recognise any noise and display it's spectra. Only actual input through mic such as conversations and music are displayed which can be categorised as real inputs or audio, and of course in real time.
- Much more dynamic and user-controlled interface.

## Installation Methods : (Now Extension available)

<details>

<summary> Installation & Usage (Using VSCode Extensions - Marketplace)</summary>

# How to Use the Audio-SpectraCLI Extension

Follow these steps to use the Audio-SpectraCLI extension in Visual Studio Code:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**
   - Launch VS Code on your computer (macOS, Windows, or Linux).

2. **Install the Audio-SpectraCLI Extension**
   - Go to the Extensions sidebar by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for "Audio-SpectraCLI" in the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Click **Install** next to the Audio-SpectraCLI extension.

3. **Install the Python package**
   - The live visualizer commands (below) spawn a Python process, so you
     need `Audio_SpectraCLI` installed and on your `PATH`:
     `pip install Audio-SpectraCLI` (see the pip installation section
     further down, or the [root README](../Readme.md)).
   - If your Python executable isn't named `python3` or isn't on `PATH`,
     set it in VS Code settings under `audioSpectraCli.pythonPath`.

4. **Activate the Extension**
   - After installation, open the Command Palette by pressing `F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS.
   - Type `>Audio-SpectraCLI` to see all available commands.

5. **Using the Commands**
   - **Start Live Visualization**: Opens a webview panel inside VS Code and
     streams a real, live FFT spectrum from your microphone into it.
     - Run `Audio-SpectraCLI: Start Live Visualization` from the Command Palette.
     - Behind the scenes this spawns `python -m Audio_SpectraCLI.headless`
       and renders its streamed JSON frames on a canvas - no matplotlib/Qt
       window pops up, everything renders inside the VS Code panel.
     - Configurable via the `audioSpectraCli.sampleRate`,
       `audioSpectraCli.blockSize`, and `audioSpectraCli.bars` settings.
   - **Stop Live Visualization**: Stops the spawned process and closes the panel.
     - Run `Audio-SpectraCLI: Stop Live Visualization` from the Command Palette
       (or just close the panel).
   - **Add Sample Code**: Inserts sample code for Audio-SpectraCLI into the current editor window.
     - Open any Python file or create a new one.
     - Run the command `Audio-SpectraCLI: Add Sample Code` from the Command Palette.
     - The sample code should appear in the editor.
   - **View Extension Status**: Displays the current status of Audio-SpectraCLI.
     - Run the command `Audio-SpectraCLI: View Status` from the Command Palette.
     - You’ll see a notification indicating that Audio-SpectraCLI is ready to use.

6. **Verify the Extension**
   - Ensure that the Audio-SpectraCLI commands work as expected by following the steps above.
   - You should see notifications for the status and sample code added in the editor.

7. **Customize as Needed**
   - You can modify the inserted code or use the extension as a reference for developing your own custom scripts with Audio-SpectraCLI.

> **Note**: If you encounter issues, check the extension's [README](./README.md) or reach out to contact@adityaseth.in support for troubleshooting.

Enjoy using Audio-SpectraCLI in VS Code!

Once you have activated the audio_visualizer instance, feel free to use it wherever in the program. It consists of several parameters (which gives more control to the user), so make sure to configure and add those before using it in your code. Also, the user can modify (wrt [v4.1.0](https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/Audio-SpectraCLI/tree/4.1.0)) the Duration (in seconds), Sampling Rate (in Hz), and Block Size.

- You can use [Example.py](https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/Audio-SpectraCLI/blob/main/tests/test.py) as a reference or use the following code :

```python
from Audio_SpectraCLI import AudioSpectrumVisualizer
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication

# Creating an instance of AudioSpectrumVisualizer with custom parameters
app = QApplication([])
audio_visualizer = AudioSpectrumVisualizer(
    duration=5, fs=22050, block_size=1024, frequency_range=(1000, 5000), color='red')

# Starting the audio spectrum visualization
audio_visualizer.show()
app.exec_()
```
